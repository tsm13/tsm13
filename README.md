🖥️ I’m TSM, web and games enthusiast. 🎮

🌱 I'm a junior front-end developer aspiring to become a full-stack web developer. I have some months worth of experience with Angular on a private project done in my previous job, so I'm familiar with the basics, and know a little of RxJS. But currently I'm learning ReactJS, with some C# and Unity Engine on the side.

🧠 My portfolio is currently lacking in recent activities while I build my React skills, but I do have some personal projects that I want to bring to life in the near future!
