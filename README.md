## 🖥️ Hello! Olá! 初めまして！ ✧٩(ˊωˋ*)و✧ 🎮

I'm a former languages major, now junior front-end developer with a passion for web-development and games, aspiring and practicing to become a full-stack web developer. And, (hopefully!) someday, I aim to tackle game development as a hobby.

I have around 7 months worth of experience with Angular on a private project done in my previous job training, so I'm familiar with the basics, and know a little of RxJS. But feeling that my JS fundamentals were still a bit shaky, as of February '24, I temporarily halted my React journey to revisit core concepts of JS. As of April, I've started dabbling in NodeJS in my free time.

My github is currently lacking in recent activities while I move along in the courses I'm taking, but I do have some personal projects that I want to bring to life in the near future!
