- 👋 Hi, I’m @z8314, coding newbie and aspiring developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in: reading, jogging, writing and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: HTML, CSS, JS, Java and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: anything I can do! Although my skills are intermediate at best (HTML/CSS, the rest is basic), so I can't do much at the current point. 😂

A proper introduction shall be made someday...
